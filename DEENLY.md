# DEENLY
Muslim super app. For first iteration, we want Quran reading tracker feature.

## High-Level Implementation
- SPA application hosted in GitHub pages
- Database and authentication with Firebase
- Modern and sleek UI

## Quran Tracking Feature

### Product Requirements
- User can create like a "reading group" or "reading journey" that tracks completing reading the Quran. Quran can be read out of order, but it has to be all the verses, hence traditional bookmarking may not be sufficient.
- User can log reading to the reading group like from verse 2:121 to 3:20
- User can invite other users to the reading journey and let them contribute logging their readings
