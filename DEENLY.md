## Deployment & Technical Notes

### Creating Static Pages with Different OpenGraph Tags

For pages that need different OpenGraph tags (e.g., invite links), we use a **post-build script approach**:

1. **How it works**:
   - Main `index.html`: Generic landing page OpenGraph tags
   - Post-build script (`scripts/post-build.js`): Automatically creates `dist/join/index.html` with invite-specific tags
   - The script runs after `vite build` and copies the built HTML with modified OG tags
   - All asset paths are automatically correct (handled by Vite's build process)

2. **Benefits of this approach**:
   - ✅ Single source of truth - only main `index.html` needs maintenance
   - ✅ All asset paths automatically correct (generated by Vite)
   - ✅ Real users get the full React app (no redirect hacks needed)
   - ✅ Social crawlers see appropriate OG tags based on URL
   - ✅ Works in both development and production

3. **To create a new page with different OG tags**:
   - Update `scripts/post-build.js` to generate the new page
   - Copy and modify the OpenGraph/Twitter meta tags as needed
   - The script runs automatically during `npm run build`

4. **Routing Structure**:
   - Use query params for pages with separate HTML files: `/join?journey=id`
   - This allows GitHub Pages to serve the correct `dist/join/index.html`
   - React Router uses `useSearchParams` instead of `useParams`

5. **Development Note**: In dev mode (`npm run dev`), there's only one HTML file, so OG tags will be generic. The specialized pages only exist in the production build.

## Quran Tracking Feature

### Product Requirements
- User can create like a "reading group" or "reading journey" that tracks completing reading the Quran. Quran can be read out of order, but it has to be all the verses, hence traditional bookmarking may not be sufficient.
- User can log reading to the reading group like from verse 2:121 to 3:20
- User can invite other users to the reading journey and let them contribute logging their readings
